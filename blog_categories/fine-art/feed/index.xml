Crazy man Michael was walking<br />
He met with a raven with eyes black as coals<br />
And shortly they were a-talking<br />
Your future, your future I would tell to you<br />
Your future you often have asked me<br />
Your true love will die by your own right hand<br />
And crazy man Michael will cursèd be&#8230;</p>

<strong>Clouds</strong></p>
<p>I’d have to be really quick<br />
to describe clouds &#8211;<br />
a split second’s enough<br />
for them to start being something else.</p>
<p>Their trademark:<br />
they don’t repeat a single<br />
shape, shade, pose, arrangement.</p>
<p>Unburdened by memory of any kind,<br />
they float easily over the facts.</p>
<p>What on earth could they bear witness to?<br />
They scatter whenever something happens.</p>
<p>Compared to clouds,<br />
life rests on solid ground,<br />
practically permanent, almost eternal.</p>
<p>Next to clouds<br />
even a stone seems like a brother,<br />
someone you can trust,<br />
while they’re just distant, flighty cousins.</p>
<p>Let people exist if they want,<br />
and then die, one after another:<br />
clouds simply don&#8217;t care<br />
what they&#8217;re up to<br />
down there.</p>
<p>And so their haughty fleet<br />
cruises smoothly over your whole life<br />
and mine, still incomplete.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t obliged to vanish when we&#8217;re gone.<br />
They don&#8217;t have to be seen while sailing on.</p>
<p><strong>Wislawa Szymborska</strong></p>
