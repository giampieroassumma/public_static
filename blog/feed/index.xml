Crazy man Michael was walking<br />
He met with a raven with eyes black as coals<br />
And shortly they were a-talking<br />
Your future, your future I would tell to you<br />
Your future you often have asked me<br />
Your true love will die by your own right hand<br />
And crazy man Michael will cursèd be&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The photograph serie ‘The lower world’ by photographer Giampiero Assumma could be of interest to H-Madness readers.                                          The project is described as follows:</p>
<p><em>“‘The Lower World’ is the title of Giampiero Assumma’s photographic long term project (2001-2014) on human alienation within the context of the last six criminal lunatic asylums in Italy, named ‘Ospedale Psichiatrico Giudiziario’ (O.P.G).</em> <em>These facilities, with the exception of one pioneering institution that was purely a psychiatric hospital, showed the characteristics of penitentiary institutes. That situation represented the evidence of a long standing debate, about crimes when related to mental illness and sentences as a cure, to serve into an institution which combines both medical treatment and strict social control. In recent years a Governmental investigation, reported several cases of violation of human rights, and all the last Italian judiciary mental institutions began their final dismission from 2015 until now.</em> <em>Beyond the inevitable political foreground, Giampiero Assumma’s approach is quite far from photojournalistic visuals. He offers his own constructive interpretation of mental illness, exposing the vulnerability inherent to the human condition.</em> <em>These images ultimately witness all those shared acts of resistance, that humans have always brought foreword to avoid being deleted from their personal history”</em></p>

<strong>Clouds</strong></p>
<p>I’d have to be really quick<br />
to describe clouds &#8211;<br />
a split second’s enough<br />
for them to start being something else.</p>
<p>Their trademark:<br />
they don’t repeat a single<br />
shape, shade, pose, arrangement.</p>
<p>Unburdened by memory of any kind,<br />
they float easily over the facts.</p>
<p>What on earth could they bear witness to?<br />
They scatter whenever something happens.</p>
<p>Compared to clouds,<br />
life rests on solid ground,<br />
practically permanent, almost eternal.</p>
<p>Next to clouds<br />
even a stone seems like a brother,<br />
someone you can trust,<br />
while they’re just distant, flighty cousins.</p>
<p>Let people exist if they want,<br />
and then die, one after another:<br />
clouds simply don&#8217;t care<br />
what they&#8217;re up to<br />
down there.</p>
<p>And so their haughty fleet<br />
cruises smoothly over your whole life<br />
and mine, still incomplete.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t obliged to vanish when we&#8217;re gone.<br />
They don&#8217;t have to be seen while sailing on.</p>
<p><strong>Wislawa Szymborska</strong></p>
